# spam-classifier-web-app
This project features a machine learning model for classifying emails as either spam or ham (non-spam). The Jupyter Notebook (spam_classification.ipynb) covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The trained model (model.pkl and vectorizer.pkl) is ready for use in spam classification applications
